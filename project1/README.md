# Project 1

ENGO 551



This project creates a website that allows the user to log in or register for their personal accounts.
I made a python files with a few of htmls files and have them connected to the database. 


The html files are all in templates folder.






'application.py' is the main file that has connects the source code to the remote database and keep track of everything whtinin the html and database.




Due to the various reasons, I am unable to successfully run the entire project. However, I wrote most of the codes.
